  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>We just started cooking with a 30-inch gas grill after decades of using a charcoal grill. While we still use the charcoal grill, the extra space allotted to us on the gas grill has made us really branch out with different sides. I created this one knowing we could put the potatoes directly on the grill and not have to make a foil packet to make it fit!</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Â¼ cup olive oil</li>
    <li>1 large clove garlic, peeled and crushed</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary, or more to taste</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme, or more to taste</li>
    <li>4 Idaho potatoes, each cut into 8 wedges</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
    <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <p>Combine olive oil, crushed garlic, chopped rosemary, and chopped thyme in a covered container; let stand for 2 hours or longer.</p>
  <p>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</p>
  <p>Put potatoes in a large saucepan and pour in enough salted water to cover; bring to a boil; cook over medium-high heat until mostly tender, 8 to 9 minutes. Drain potatoes and transfer to a bowl.</p>
  <p>Remove garlic from the olive oil mixture and discard. Pour oil over potatoes, sprinkle with garlic salt and black pepper, and toss to coat.</p>
  <p>Place potatoes skin-side down on the grill over direct heat; reserve remaining oil. Grill for 10 minutes; move potatoes to indirect heat until completely cooked, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a serving bowl and drizzle remaining oil over potatoes.</p>
